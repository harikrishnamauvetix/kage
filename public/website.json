While some are harmless and asymptomatic, others may be precancerous or cancerous, requiring timely evaluation and treatment. Pseudocysts, on the other hand, are non-cancerous cyst-like collections of fluid often caused by pancreatitis or trauma. At KIMS Advanced Gastroenterology & Endoscopy - KAGE Pancreas Clinic in Hyderabad, we specialize in the accurate diagnosis and management of pancreatic cysts and pseudocysts using the latest technology and a multidisciplinary approach."

This condition is commonly seen in patients with cirrhosis or other chronic liver diseases. It can lead to severe complications, including variceal bleeding and ascites. At KIMS Advanced Gastroenterology & Endoscopy - KAGE’s Advanced Liver Care and Transplant Clinic in Hyderabad, we specialize in diagnosing and managing portal hypertension with a multidisciplinary approach and advanced interventions."
