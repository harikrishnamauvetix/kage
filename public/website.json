Unlike traditional surgeries, POEM utilizes advanced endoscopic technology to offer a solution that is not only effective but also comes with a faster recovery time and reduced discomfort. At KIMS Advanced Gastroenterology & Endoscopy - KAGE, we bring this innovative technique directly to our patients. We believe in harnessing the power of precision medicine to ensure that each patient experiences a smoother journey from diagnosis to recovery."
